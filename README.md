Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) HW

Title: Create a Simple Library Management System
________________________________________
Objective:
Design and implement a small library management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
________________________________________

Requirements:
Tasks to Implement:
o	Create a List of LibraryItem objects to hold a collection of books, magazines, and DVDs.
o	Implement a menu-driven program that allows users to:
1.	Add a new library item (Book, Magazine, or DVD).
2.	View details of all items.
3.	Borrow an item (displaying the corresponding message).
4.	Exit the program.
________________________________________
Additional Guidelines:
•	Encapsulation: Use appropriate access modifiers (private, protected, public) to ensure data security.
•	Polymorphism: Use method overriding (virtual and override) for behavior customization.
•	Abstraction: Use the abstract keyword for the base class and its methods.
•	Inheritance: Use derived classes to extend the functionality of the base class.

Sample Output:
Welcome to the Library Management System!
1. Add Library Item
2. View All Items
3. Borrow an Item
4. vide Game
5. Exit

________________________________________Ensure your code is clean, properly commented, and follows OOP principles.
